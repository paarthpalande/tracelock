# TRACELOCK

> Securing Your Data, Securing Your Future...

TRACELOCK is a simple, colorized log analysis tool for Linux/Windows text logs. It scans log files for common security-related events (authentication failures, session open/close, kernel messages, warnings, service start/stop, etc.) and prints color-coded matches to make triage faster.

---

## Features

* Parse Linux and Windows (text-exported) logs
* Categories: authentication failures, session alerts, connections, kernel/system logs, service start/stop, warnings, and more
* Colorized terminal output for quick visual triage (requires `colorama`)
* Menu-driven, non-recursive interface for easier navigation
* Safe handling of empty results and file errors

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* `pyfiglet` (for banner)
* `colorama` (for colored output)

Install dependencies with pip:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet colorama
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repo or copy `tracelock.py` to your machine.
2. Ensure the script is executable or invoke with Python:

```bash
python3 tracelock.py
```

> Notes: Many system logs in `/var/log/` require root privileges. Instead of running the script as `sudo`, it's often safer to export the needed portion of a system log to a file you own (e.g., `sudo journalctl -u ssh -n 500 --no-pager > ~/ssh_journal.txt`) and run TRACELOCK against that file.

---

## Usage

Run the script and follow the interactive menu:

```bash
python3 tracelock.py
```

1. Choose **Linux Log** or **Windows Log**.
2. Provide the path to a text log file (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log` or `~/ssh_journal.txt`).
3. Pick a category from the menu to view matches (colorized output).

### Quick test

Create a small test log and run TRACELOCK:

```bash
cat > ~/tracelock_test.log <<'EOF'
Sep 18 09:15:23 kali sshd[1223]: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=192.168.1.50
Sep 18 09:20:45 kali systemd[1]: session opened for user kali by (uid=0)
Sep 18 09:30:11 kali kernel: usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -71
EOF

python3 tracelock.py
# Choose Linux Log, then enter: /home/<you>/tracelock_test.log
```

---

## Sample output

(TRACELOCK prints category headers, a count of matches, and the matching log lines colorized. See the repository examples or run the test above.)

---

## Exporting journalctl output

If your system uses systemd, you can export logs to a file and analyze them with TRACELOCK:

```bash
sudo journalctl -n 500 --no-pager > ~/system_journal.txt
python3 tracelock.py
# enter: /home/<you>/system_journal.txt
```

## Publishing to GitHub (quick commands)

If you havenâ€™t already initialized a git repo, hereâ€™s a minimal workflow:

```bash
git init
git add tracelock.py README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: TRACELOCK log analyzer"
# create a repository on GitHub (via web) then add remote, for example:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/tracelock.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
